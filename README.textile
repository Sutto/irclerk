h1. IRClerk - Sinatra + CouchDB + Marvin == IRC logging goodness

h2. Getting started

Firstly, Clone this repo and then change to the top level directory.

Next, run the following commands to prepare your database:

  @./couchdb-setup/reset-database@

  @./couchdb-setup/import-views@

Now, to use the irc bot, you'll need two things:

# The marvin gem - use @sudo gem install Sutto-marvin --source=https://gems.github.com/@
# Edit @irc-bot/config/settings.yml@ and @irc-bot/config/connections.yml@

Next, start up the logger bot:
  
  @marvin client irc-bot -v@
  
Optionally, you can add -d if you want to run it in the background.

If you now check the channels / write a few messages, and then check the db using futon
(the couchdb web admin interface, you should see they've been logged.)

Next, run @ruby application.rb@ inside the web app directory, surf to @http://localhost:4567/@
and enjoy!
